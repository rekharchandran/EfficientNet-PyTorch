# What is EfficientNet?
EfficientNet (or perhaps it's better to say EfficientNets) is a family of convolutional neural network-based image classification models. They perform extremely well on the state-of-the-art ImageNet dataset and other popular datasets such as CIFAR-100 and Flowers.

In addition to performing so well, the architecture is small and computes faster than any of the previous models. The architecture has variants ranging from EfficientNet-B0 up to EffieicntNet-B7.

The variants ranging from B0 to B7 are based on the compound scaling method to scale up the baseline in B0 to obtain B1 to B7. EfficientNet-B7 acquired a Top-1 accuracy of 84.4% on the ImageNet dataset, which is the highest level of Top-1 accuracy ever achieved on ImageNet.
